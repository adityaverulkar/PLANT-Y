# 🌿 **PLANT-Y**

## 📌 **Overview**
**PLANT-Y** is a deep learning-based image classification project developed to detect and classify **plant diseases** from leaf images 🍃. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model achieves a strong performance with an **accuracy of ~85%** on the test set.

This project helps support early disease detection in plants, aiding timely intervention for healthier crops.

## 📂 **Dataset**
- **Source**:  
  - 🌱 [New Plant Diseases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset) from Kaggle
- **Classes**:  
  - Contains images of healthy and diseased plant leaves across various plant species
  - Multiple disease categories for comprehensive classification
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation (rotation, flipping) for generalization.

## 🛠️ **Installation**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PLANT-Y.git
cd PLANT-Y
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 **Benefits & Usage**
PLANT-Y delivers significant value across multiple agricultural contexts:

1. **Early Disease Detection:** Identify plant diseases before they become visible to the naked eye, allowing for timely intervention and treatment.
2. **Reduced Crop Losses:** By enabling quick identification of infected plants, farmers can prevent disease spread and minimize yield losses.
3. **Optimized Resource Use:** Target pesticide and treatment application only where needed, reducing chemical usage and environmental impact.
4. **Accessible Expertise:** Provides expert-level plant pathology insights even in remote areas with limited access to agricultural specialists.
5. **Educational Tool:** Helps farmers and gardeners learn to recognize disease patterns and improve their plant care knowledge.
